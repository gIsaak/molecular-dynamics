# Weekly progress journal

## Instructions

In this journal you will document your progress of the project, making use of the weekly milestones.

Every week you should 

1. write down **on Wednesday** a short plan (bullet list is sufficient) of how you want to 
   reach the weekly milestones. Think about how to distribute work in the group, 
   what pieces of code functionality need to be implemented. 
2. write about your progress **before** the Tuesday in the next week with respect to the milestones.
   Substantiate your progress with links to code, pictures or test results. Reflect on the
   relation to your original plan.

We will give feedback on your progress on Tuesday before the following lecture. Consult the 
[grading scheme](https://computationalphysics.quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/proj1-moldyn-grading/) 
for details how the journal enters your grade.

Note that the file format of the journal is *markdown*. This is a flexible and easy method of 
converting text to HTML. 
Documentation of the syntax of markdown can be found 
[here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#gfm-extends-standard-markdown). 
You will find how to include [links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#links) and 
[images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#images) particularly
useful.

## Week 1
(due before 18 February)
Wednesday 12 February (Group)
TODO List Week 1:
- Decide how to store particle velocity and position at each timestep
- Implement function to calculate Lennard-Jones potential between particles
- Implement function to perform Euler method for time evolution
- Account for periodic boundary conditions
- Implement function to calculate kinetic, potential and total energies of system

Sunday 16 February (Brennan)
- implemented functions for easier access to parameters
- built prototype functions for calculating distance between particles
with periodic boundary conditions
- calculated total potential and kinetic energies of particles
- calculating force between particles in progress

Monday 17 February (Brennan)
- The tracked directory was set up by the bot. Our previous directory was private.
All commits to our (old) journal along with the code in main.py have been moved
to the new repository.
