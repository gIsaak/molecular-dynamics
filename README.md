# Project 1: Molecular dynamics simulation of Argon atoms

This project simulates the dynamics of Argon atoms under the influence of a Lennard-Jones potential.
Currently, two particles moving in a box with periodic boundary conditions are simulated for a
user-defined number of timesteps. The particle positions are plotted in a separate window as
the simulation progresses.

Requisites: numpy,matplotlib
